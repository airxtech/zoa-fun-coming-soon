## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- All new code must be written in TypeScript
- Use proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use strict mode (`strict: true` in tsconfig)

### Component Structure

```typescript
'use client'; // For client components

import { useState } from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { Icon } from 'lucide-react';

interface ComponentProps {
  // Define props with proper types
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}

export const MyComponent = ({ title, description }: ComponentProps) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<string>('');

  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
    >
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {description && <p>{description}</p>}
    </motion.div>
  );
};
```

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Use `className` for conditional styling
- Avoid inline styles except for dynamic values
- Keep color values consistent with the design system

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PulsingOrb.tsx`)
- Utilities: `camelCase` (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Folders: `kebab-case` (e.g., `ui-components/`)

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
# Good
feat: Add countdown timer component
fix: Correct animation timing in PulsingOrb
docs: Update deployment instructions

# Bad
update
fixed stuff
wip
```

## Project Structure

Please maintain the existing project structure:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                    # Next.js app directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx           # Main page component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx         # Root layout
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css        # Global styles
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/               # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FloatingShapes.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FloatingParticles.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ lib/                  # Utility functions (future)
```

## Development Workflow

### Setup Development Environment

## Performance Guidelines

- Minimize re-renders with proper memoization
- Use code splitting with `React.lazy`
- Optimize animations with Framer Motion
- Keep component sizes manageable
- Lazy load heavy components

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Test keyboard navigation
- Use descriptive alt text for images

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Add JSDoc comments to complex functions
- Update this CONTRIBUTING.md if needed
- Keep comments clear and concise
